## Project
### [Einstein Chess AI Gaming Project](https://github.com/Shuning0312/Einstein-Chess-AI-Gaming-Project)
- **Project Introduction:** Master the principles and programming implementation of game theory algorithms, combined with Monte Carlo algorithm, Expectimax algorithm, UCT algorithm, as well as Q-Learning algorithm in reinforcement learning, to compute and simulate the optimal chess moves, thus realizing the process of computer gaming. 
- **The main implementation content of the project:** Using the WinBGIm graphics library to design the interface of a chess software, implementing basic functions such as human-computer gameplay and saving chess information files through C programming language. This significantly increased the game's winning rate, leading to achieving a national-level third prize in chess competitions.


## Competitions
- **[Aug. 2021]** China Computer Games Competition _Connect Six project_, Second Prize at the National Level;
- **[Sep. 2021]** China Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling, Second Prize in Liaoning Province;
