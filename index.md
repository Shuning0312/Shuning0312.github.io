## Biography

Hello! I am a M.S. student at Hangzhou Institute for Advanced Study, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. I obtained my B.E. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at Shenyang University of Technology in 2023.

My research interests lie in the intersection of **Computer Vision** and **AICG**. From 2023, I started to do research on image/video restoration. Now, I focus on designing novel applications for image/video restoration and AIGC tasks.

I am also passionate about crypto and Web3, having developed several innovative projects in this domain.

_📧 Feel free to contact me by email if you are interested in discussing or collaborating with me._
